# Cli-Ching

A simple Python script to generate hexagrams using the I Ching method with italian translation.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hexagram-generator.git
```
2. **Change to the project directory:**
```bash
cd cliching
```

3. **Run the script:**
```bash
python cliching.py
```

## Usage
Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. Run the script by executing the following command:

```bash
./cliching.py
```

## How It Works
The script simulates the traditional I Ching method of generating hexagrams by tossing coins. The resulting hexagram is then looked up in a JSON file (hexagrams.json) for interpretation.
